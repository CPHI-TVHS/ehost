This is an imported and polished version of [eHOST: The Extensible Human Oracle Suite of Tools an open source annotation tool](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ehost/).

1. Rearrange the code under maven framework
2. Allows to delete annotation with single press "Delete" key
3. Sort projects on names
4. Sort files on names
5. Allows to export annotations to excel (Developed by [Chris Leng](https://github.com/chrisleng/ehost))
6. Sync the highlighter of file navigation panel when selecting file from other places (e.g. dropdown list)
7. Save last view file within each project, so that can be easily resumed to that file when open a project next time.
8. Allows remote control through RESTful API.
